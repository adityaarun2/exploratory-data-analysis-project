## Introduction

Welcome to the exploratory data analysis project on the relationship between cooking time and average rating of recipes! This project aims to investigate whether there is a correlation between how long a recipe takes to cook and how highly it is rated by users.

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on a variety of recipes, including their ingredients, cooking times, and user ratings. By exploring this data, we hope to gain insights into the factors that contribute to a recipe's success and popularity. This dataset contains recipes and ratings from [(food.com)].

This website will serve as a platform to share our findings and visualizations with others. It will include an overview of the project, a description of the dataset and methodology, interactive visualizations, and a conclusion summarizing our key findings.
